# SE---Lab-Assignment-2

This program receives a file of grades and outputs a histogram of those grades.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open the file by running the jar file (You can just use your command line). In order to input a file for building its histogram you have to enter the path of the existing file after the name of the executable jar. Please take into consideration that only grades between 0-10 will be counted. Don't forget to use double \\ between the files of the path so the string is inputed aproprietly.
